      "For individuals without smartphones, the app can generate a printed ESi ID card, enabling access to funds and participation in the system without requiring digital literacy.",
      "The printed ESi card functions like a debit card. It allows the holder to spend or transfer funds when transacting with someone using the ESi app on a smartphone — an ideal setup for everyday transactions, such as purchasing goods from vendors."
